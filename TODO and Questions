TODO:
  - Cleaning up existing plots:
    - Set standard color pallette (color brewer Set2)
    - Ensure p & R2 values are prefaced with matching legend labels 
      (and ensure each relevant plot contains the lm data)
    - Set unique point shapes for colorless viewability (not necessary)
    - Standarize point sizes
    - Separate CCS annual means from medians
    - Clean up axis labels, etc.

TODO:
  - Log transform wind/current speeds in ERDDAp
  - Get eelgrass polygons into R and compare number of crossing from vessel data.
  - Clean up labeling in CCS graphs (add variable metadata)
  - Look at how NPS report examined sediment type and sediment changes
  
  
  Meeting with Jill and Presseda:
  - Check if CCS total sum of nitrate_nitrite and ammonium equal total N
  - Plot summer DO vs temp? How do they vary seasonally together?
  - How do temperature and nitrate_nitrite (or total N) vary seasonally together?
  - Need to look at extreme weather events***
  - Look at sediment type
  - Share out link
  - NPS sediment type - Did it change over time? Did the percent cover change differently with
    sediment type?
  - Extreme weather event frequency
  

Workflow Plan:
  - Find land based wind direction and speed data longer time series
  - Begin to document data collection and analysis process
  - Begin to lay out report
    - Go by data source
      - Make map of the sites (in consistent format)
      - Metadata of site
      - Data organization process

Questions:
  - There are multiple years where the CCS data only has 11 months of data collected.
    Should I include? How?
  - Which plots do we know we plan to include in final report? So I can finalize formatting and 
    begin writing up data analysis



NOTES from Wellfleet Planning Call:
- Shellfish dragging occurs in circular motion
- Take a look at land based wind direction and speed measurements
