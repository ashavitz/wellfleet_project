TODO:
  - Revise data import to include all data, replacing non-"good" qc data with NAs
  - When calculating statistics (e.g. means) from shorter time series data, remove 
    intervals without complete data (e.g. if summarizing for a day from 5 min data,
    only include days with complete data)
  - Create time series graphs from 1995 (or earliest date if after 1995) for all variables
  


Questions:
  - How should daily/monthly means be calculated when there is variable patchiness in the data? For example, if I do
    a simple mean, some days may be missing all values from a portion of the day, which would skew the data.
    - Consider options: impute missing data, use only days with complete data, other?
  - For simplicity, I have been simply importing data where all observations of all variables have "good" qc ratings. 
    However, this will exclude some "good" values, because there are instances where one variable is "good" 
    while others are not. Is it better practice to import all data, and then mark non-"good" variables as NA?
