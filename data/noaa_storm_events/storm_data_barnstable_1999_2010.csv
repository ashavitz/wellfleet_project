The highest snowfall totals were reported from the east slopes of the Berkshires across Worcester County and into northeast Massachusetts, where amounts of 15 to 30 inches were common.   Greater Boston received between 12 and 22 inches of snow, but Logan International Airport received 9.8 inches from this storm.  Amounts in southeast Massachusetts ranged from 2 to 4 inches along the immediate coast to as much as a foot farther inland.  Other official totals include 23 inches at the Blue Hills Observatory in Milton, 22 inches at Worcester Airport, and 9.5 inches at the National Weather Service in Taunton.

Powerful northeast winds affected much of east coastal and southeast Massachusetts.  Speeds of 50 to 60 mph were widely observed and caused damage to trees and power lines,  especially on Cape Cod and the islands.

There were also many reports of downed trees and wires during the height of the storm, along with reports of lightning and thunder.  Hundreds of flights at Logan International Airport were canceled, as were flights at other nearby airports.  In magnitude, it was the worst storm to affect the state since 1992, and a state of emergency was in effect for three days.  After the storm, the weight of the heavy wet snow caused several roof collapses throughout the state, most notably at a church in Westford.  No injuries were reported.

The more significant impact of this storm was widespread coastal flooding.  A high astronomical tide combined with 15-foot seas to cause flooding along most of the eastern Massachusetts coastline.  In Marblehead, the downtown area was closed off after being flooded, and waves swept over the road to Marblehead Neck, shutting it down.  The storm surge also shut down sections of Route 129, throwing mud, rock, and a section of boardwalk across the road.  In Swampscott, a 60-foot section of sea wall along Blodgett Avenue collapsed, forcing the evacuation of several homes.  The Nahant Causeway was closed for almost four hours due to flooding, cutting off access to the peninsula.  Damage was most severe in Winthrop.  Waves crashed over the sea wall protecting Point Shirley during the midday high tide, inundating streets with up to 5 feet of water and flooding scores of cars and basements.  In all, about 50 homes were flooded.  In Scituate, another hard hit area, about 40 houses along Turner Road were left without power.  Residents estimated that 8 to 10 feet of water flooded Seventh Avenue, requiring evacuation.  In Humarock, a narrow strip of land in Scituate that often gets the worst of coastal storms, residents used front-end loaders and backhoes to clear mud and rocks from Central Avenue.  The road was closed with some sections flooded with several feet of water.  Mounds of rocks, brought in by the tide, were piled as high as 10 feet along the side of the road.  In all, as many as 10 roads in Scituate were fully or partly closed during high tide.  In Marshfield, several feet of water flooded roads in Brant Rock and police blocked off Hewitt's Point and the esplanade for several hours.  Waves crested over sea walls in Plymouth and left several areas submerged in 2 to 3 feet of water.  A portion of Route 3A was flooded.

No significant storm damage was reported, mainly due to the fluffy, light nature of the snow as temperatures dropped into the teens and 20s during the storm.

Despite the tremendous snowfall totals, the overall impact of the storm was minimal since it occurred on a holiday and during school vacation week.  However, numerous minor accidents were reported.  In addition, no significant damage was reported due to the fluffy, light nature of the snow.

Officially, the storm total at Logan International Airport in Boston was 27.5 inches, which set a record for the greatest snowstorm in Boston.  The total eclipsed the previous record of 27.1 inches set during the Blizzard of 1978 on February 6th and 7th, though it should be noted that this storm had much less of an impact on the region and pales in overall comparison to the Blizzard of 1978.  That storm produced high winds, significant coastal flooding, and more than 3 feet of snow in some areas, crippling the state for several days.

No serious injuries were reported, but hundreds of people were stranded for several hours after authorities shut down a ten mile stretch of I-95 from Attleboro to the Rhode Island border.  The treacherous conditions also caused two smaller multi-vehicle accidents in the region - one involving a dozen vehicles on Route 3 in Kingston and the other affecting about twenty vehicles on Route 24 near Interstate 495.
