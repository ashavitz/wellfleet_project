This storm was one of the most significant winter storms to hit southern New England in the past 20 years and was named "The Blizzard of '96" as it dumped record snowfalls from the mid-Atlantic states to southern New England.  Technically, this storm only reached a true blizzard by National Weather Service criteria for a few hours in a small section of eastern Massachusetts around South Weymouth during the early morning hours on January 8th.  Very heavy snowfall, which was measured in feet, was the main effect of this storm.  It was the most region-wide heavy snowfall since the "Blizzard of '78."  Totals ranged from 15 to 25 inches, with many totals of 20 to 25 inches in parts of Plymouth and Bristol Counties.  Totals of 13 to 18 inches were reported from Cape Cod and the Islands.  There was a brief change to rain on parts of the Cape.  More than 20 inches were reported in parts of Hampden and Hampshire Counties of western Massachusetts with more than 30 inches in some places in the Berkshires.  Snowfall from this storm totalled 18 inches at Boston and the total snow depth on the ground hit 30 inches, breaking the all-time record of 29 inches set at the end of the "Blizzard of '78."

Strong to gale force northeast winds along the coast threatened to bring coastal flooding, but a wind shift to the north and parallel to the Massachusetts east coast resulted in a decreasing storm surge from around 2.7 feet to 1.9 feet at the Boston tide gauge by the time of the early afternoon high tide on January 8th.  Only a few coastal roads were closed due to flooding.  However, on the eastern shore of Nantucket Island, high waves and stronger than usual ocean currents eroded sand dunes and did an estimated $200,000 damage to cottages in an area that suffered damage from previous nor'easters.  A building inspector on Nantucket stated that the Gulf Stream had been displaced farther to the north than usual and that greater sea surface temperature differences caused faster currents along the shore.  The main impact of this storm, though, was the closure of schools, businesses, airports, and transportation systems for a long duration.

The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency reported damage claims of $32 million from approximately 350 communities, mostly for the costs of snow removal (see damage figures above).

The combination of this snowfall, earlier snowfalls, and subsequent rainfall events resulted in the collapse of many roofs within a week to two weeks after the storm.  In Whitman, a section of a skating rink roof collapsed, injuring four women.  In Foxborough, on January 12th, after several more inches of snow and then some heavy rain, a roof collapsed at one of the water department buildings.  On January 13th, a woman was evacuated from her mobile home in Marlborough after the roof collapsed.  More than 70 people were evacuated from a condominium in Framingham after the roof cracked and then caved in.  In Franklin, a house suffered structural damage from the weight of the snow, while in Townsend a barn roof collapsed killing 8 dairy cows.  Other roof collapses were reported at a church in Chelmsford, a business in Tyngsborough, and at a mall in Tewksbury.  On January 14th, the roof of a two-story house collapsed in West Springfield, resulting in an estimated $150,000 damage to the structure.  The roof of a garage in Northampton collapsed.  The building was reported to be a total loss.  In Monson, a barn roof collapsed.  A number of people were injured when they fell while clearing snow from their roofs.  On January 19th, the roof of a barn collapsed in Framingham, killing two horses.",1

The intensifying system then moved nearly parallel to the Mid-Atlantic coast with its center reaching Plymouth County in southeastern Massachusetts during the early morning hours of December 8th.  Temperatures rose into the 50s along and east of the track of the low center...over Plymouth County and Cape Cod.  Heavy precipitation occurred across all of Massachusetts with rain over coastal areas and the southeast part of the state and heavy snow in all of western and central Massachusetts and much of Middlesex and Essex counties in the northeastern part of the state.  A very distinct rain-snow line existed throughout this storm.  It was oriented from south-southwest to north-northeast and extended from extreme western Norfolk County across Middlesex County to Essex County.  Lightning and thunder was observed during the evening of December 7th along the rain-snow line.

The snow was especially wet and heavy, resulting in heavy damage to trees and power lines.  Power lines and tree limbs began snapping under the weight of the snow shortly after 7 PM on Saturday evening, December 7th.  Widespread power outages affecting tens of thousands of people occurred in Worcester, Middlesex, and Essex Counties.  Statewide, about 500,000 people lost power at some point during the storm, but extended power outages (lasting several days) occurred in central Massachusetts and the Merrimack Valley and affected about 113,000 electric customers.  Thousands of trees and limbs knocked down by the snow forced police to close sections of many roads.  At least a couple of people received minor injuries from falling tree limbs.  Hundreds of homes and vehicles were damaged when snow-laden tree limbs crashed down.  Thousands of people endured several days with no power or heat and many left their homes for shelters set up by local governments and the American Red Cross.

There is the possibility that a "gravity wave" (which results in rapid changes in wind and atmospheric pressure fields) may have played a part in this sudden and unexpected coastal flooding event.  Several small streams that empty into Mount Hope Bay rose up 3 feet out of their banks.  Flooding occurred in several Bristol County towns.

The storm was made even more unusual by its late-season occurrence.  The final snowfall totals will be included in April 1997 Storm Data, as will the final assessment of damages caused by the heavy wet snow and strong winds.

Precipitation started in the form of rain and began spreading across the state from south to north during the morning hours, but soon mixed with heavy, wet snow.  Rain changed to all snow rather quickly by late morning across western and central Massachusetts and soon changed to all snow in the eastern part of the state, except right along the coast, during the afternoon.  During the evening hours, moderate to heavy rain soon changed to heavy, wet snow even along the coast.  Blizzard conditions, which began during the afternoon across western and central Massachusetts, spread southeast covering most of the state by midnight, except over Cape Cod and the Islands and along the immediate south coastal areas and islands where snow was still mixed with some rain.  Thunder and lightning began during the late afternoon and continued intermittently throughout the night.

At Easton, in Bristol County, a gust to 60 mph was recorded at 9:30 PM.  Along the coast south of Boston, Hull had a gust to 64 mph.  Along Buzzards Bay, Onset recorded a peak gust to 64 mph.  All of the wind gusts were from the northeast and occurred in the late afternoon and early evening, when the lowest barometric pressure was recorded.  

Heavy, wet snow accumulated rapidly on all surfaces, including trees and power lines, during the late afternoon.  The evening commute became a nightmare as thousands of cars backed up on unplowed roads.  The situation was further aggravated by falling trees and power lines, which closed some roads.

The more significant impact of this storm was widespread coastal flooding.  A high astronomical tide combined with 15-foot seas to cause flooding along most of the eastern Massachusetts coastline.  In Marblehead, the downtown area was closed off after being flooded, and waves swept over the road to Marblehead Neck, shutting it down.  The storm surge also shut down sections of Route 129, throwing mud, rock, and a section of boardwalk across the road.  In Swampscott, a 60-foot section of sea wall along Blodgett Avenue collapsed, forcing the evacuation of several homes.  The Nahant Causeway was closed for almost four hours due to flooding, cutting off access to the peninsula.  Damage was most severe in Winthrop.  Waves crashed over the sea wall protecting Point Shirley during the midday high tide, inundating streets with up to 5 feet of water and flooding scores of cars and basements.  In all, about 50 homes were flooded.  In Scituate, another hard hit area, about 40 houses along Turner Road were left without power.  Residents estimated that 8 to 10 feet of water flooded Seventh Avenue, requiring evacuation.  In Humarock, a narrow strip of land in Scituate that often gets the worst of coastal storms, residents used front-end loaders and backhoes to clear mud and rocks from Central Avenue.  The road was closed with some sections flooded with several feet of water.  Mounds of rocks, brought in by the tide, were piled as high as 10 feet along the side of the road.  In all, as many as 10 roads in Scituate were fully or partly closed during high tide.  In Marshfield, several feet of water flooded roads in Brant Rock and police blocked off Hewitt's Point and the esplanade for several hours.

In addition, no significant damage was reported due to the fluffy, light nature of the snow.

The total eclipsed the previous record of 27.1 inches set during the Blizzard of 1978 on February 6th and 7th, though it should be noted that this storm had much less of an impact on the region and pales in overall comparison to the Blizzard of 1978.  That storm produced high winds, significant coastal flooding, and more than 3 feet of snow in some areas, crippling the state for several days.

This storm brought a variety of impacts in southern New England, including heavy snow to the higher elevations of western Massachusetts, damaging winds in excess of 60 mph, widespread river and stream flooding, and significant coastal flooding through several high tide cycles.|Snowfall totals as high as 4 to 8 inches were observed in the higher elevations of Franklin, Hampshire, and Hampden Counties. There were numerous reports of downed trees and power lines in these areas from the weight of the heavy, wet snow. Lesser storm totals of 1 to 3 inches were reported from northern Worcester into northwest Middlesex Counties. Most of this snow fell during the day on April 15th, and changed to rain at night as milder air was drawn into the interior.|East to northeast winds gusted as high as 60 mph in eastern Massachusetts. The highest gusts reported included 72 mph at the Blue Hill Observatory in Milton, 67 mph in East Falmouth, 64 mph on Nantucket, and 63 mph in Plymouth. There were widespread reports of downed trees, large branches, and power lines, as far inland as Taunton, Framingham, and Topsfield. Several roads were blocked by fallen trees in southeast Massachusetts. Wind damage was more sporadic across western and central Massachusetts.|Rainfall totals of 3 to 5 inches, combined with wet antecedent conditions, resulted in widespread river and stream flooding, as well as significant flooding of urban areas. The worst flooding affected the Merrimack Valley, where moderate to major flooding occurred on the Merrimack, Nashua, and North Nashua Rivers. For many locations, this may have been the worst flooding since the May, 2006 or April, 1987 floods ��� but along the North Nashua, the preliminary crests recorded may have been the highest since the floods of September, 1938.|Many small streams throughout the region also rose out of their banks and flooded nearby areas, including roadways. Major flooding occurred along the Mill River in Northampton, which required the evacuation of nearby residents. |Minor to moderate coastal flooding occurred along the coastline of|Massachusetts through several high tide cycles, due to the combination of strong onshore winds, high seas, and astronomically high tides.|Along the South Coast, the worst coastal flooding occurred with morning high tide on April 16th, where flood waters and debris closed several shore roads. In eastern Massachusetts, the worst coastal flooding occurred with the evening high tide on April 17th. Moderate flooding forced the closure of many shore roads. There were reports of cars stranded in flood waters along the Plymouth County coast. Although no injuries or fatalities were reported, four people including two children needed to be rescued from vehicles ��� one of whom nearly drowned when her car was carried away by flood waters in the Green Harbor section of Marshfield. On Nantucket, one home on Sheep Pond Road fell into the ocean after waves eroded the bluff underneath. Coastal flooding also affected Martha���s Vineyard and Chatham. A breach was opened on Norton Point Beach on Chappaquiddick Island, cutting off access to Edgartown, and also on Nauset Beach in Chatham where several cottages were cut off from the mainland.",228
