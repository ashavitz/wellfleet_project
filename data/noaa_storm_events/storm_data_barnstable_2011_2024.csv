Irene moved through the Caribbean and up the east coast of the United States making landfall twice.

She then made a 2nd landfall, again as a Category 1 Hurricane at 540am on August 28 near Little Egg Inlet in New Jersey.

At the time of the mid-morning high tide, the winds had shifted from northeast to north and the surge had dropped to 1.5 to 2.5 feet for most MA east coast locations.

What made this an amazing storm was the widespread coverage of heavy snowfall.  Most locations received 2 to 2.5 feet of snow!  A stationary band of even heavier snowfall persisted from southwest NH through central MA and on to the southwest across central and western CT. In those areas, reports averaged closer to 2.5 to 3 feet! Along the southeast MA coast, average amounts ranged from 1 to 2 feet.  Only on Martha���s Vineyard and Nantucket were snowfall totals less than 1 foot (6 to 12 inches).  Isolated thunderstorms were common across the entire region during the height of the storm.||A low pressure system advancing from the Great Lakes region combined forces with a very moist low pressure system moving northeast from the Gulf Coast states. Explosive deepening took place Friday evening, February 8, as a low center moved from the North Carolina coast to south of Nantucket.  Strong high pressure to the north of New England helped ensure that cold air remained in place over the area. Snowfall gained intensity during the afternoon, but during the night, 2 to 3 inch per hour amounts were common throughout the region. The band of heaviest snowfall, with 3 to 5 inches per hour for several hours, extended from southwest NH to central and western CT.  The precipitation started as mainly snow, although a brief period of rain at the onset was common on the Islands.  Snow ended in the morning in western and central MA, southwest NH, most of CT and RI, and in the early afternoon across eastern MA. It lingered during the whole afternoon over Cape Cod and Nantucket, aided by some ocean-effect bands of snowfall.||The Blizzard of 2013 also produced a prolonged period of very strong winds Friday night along the MA and RI coasts.  Gusts exceeded hurricane force (74 mph) at a few locations.  Gale force gusts (to 50 mph) continued on the MA coast through Saturday afternoon.  The strong winds, combined with a wet snow, led to extensive power outages from downed trees and wires in southeast coastal MA and in southern RI.  Elsewhere, farther inland, the snow became drier and did not cling to trees like it did along the south and southeast coast of New England.  Some wind gusts included: 76 mph at Logan Int���l. Airport (Boston, MA), 75 mph at Bedford, MA, 77 mph at Hyannis, MA and 68 mph in Jamestown, RI.  Damaging gusts to 60 mph were recorded as far west as Worcester County, MA.

At this point, this is a drought categorized largely by well below normal precipitation and groundwater and agricultural impacts. Most of the region experienced below normal rainfall during the month of August. Much of eastern Massachusetts south of Boston, received less than half the normal amount of rainfall for the month. The exception was southern Worcester County where above normal rainfall was experienced. However, this additional rainfall did little to dispel drought conditions.

While data thus far has been anecdotal, many farmers are having to choose which fields to irrigate and which to let go, as well as not doing 2nd and 3rd plantings of late summer crops. Known losses, according to the Massachusetts Farm Bureau Federation, include a total loss of the peach crop, reduced apple and cranberry crops, and no second and third cut hay. The Massachusetts state government declared on September 7th to make up to $1 million in microloan funds available to small, family owned farms who suffered losses due to the drought.  Eleven counties in Massachusetts were declared primary disaster counties due to the drought.  They include: Barnstable, Berkshire, Bristol, Essex, Franklin, Hampden, Hampshire, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, and Worcester Counties.  Farms in these counties are eligible for assistance from the Farm Service Agency and the Livestock Forage Disaster Program.||More than 160 public water systems in Massachusetts have imposed some sort of water use restrictions, 70 of those have the strictest parameters in place, allowing residents to use outdoor water one day a week or less.  One of these was Worcester, the second largest city in Massachusetts.  Worcester banned outdoor water use in early September and ordered restaurants to stop serving tap water unless requested by a customer because their reservoir system had dropped to 55 percent of capacity.  It's reservoirs are typically at 80 percent of capacity going into the fall.  In addition, Worcester officials activated an emergency connection to draw water from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) at a cost of $1.7 million per month.
